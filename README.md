# Graph Traversal Algorithm

This program implements a graph data structure and provides functions for building a graph, inserting and deleting nodes, finding the shortest path between two nodes, and finding the shortest path that traverses all nodes.

## Installation

To install and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Compile the source code using the following command: `gcc main.c nodes.c edges.c algo.c -o graph`.
4. Run the program using the command: `./graph`.

## Usage

The program reads user input from the console and provides the following options:

- **A**: Build the graph.
- **B**: Insert a node into the graph.
- **D**: Delete a node from the graph.
- **S**: Find the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **T**: Find the shortest path that traverses all nodes using brute force.

To select an option, enter the corresponding letter followed by any required parameters.
